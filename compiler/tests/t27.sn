    // While the above line may compile in another language (and make x = [25.0, 10.0, 15.0]), it is not allowed
    // in Serene, as it expands to:
    
    // set x[0] = x[0] + x.pop!()

    //...which is also not allowed, because x is read and mutated in the same statement.

    // But the following line is okay:
    set x[0] = x.pop!()

# Introduction

Serene is a minimalist readable systems programming language designed by Jamie Moschella (`@jammmo`). This site will walk you through the basic design of the language as well as several code examples. Serene's compiler is in early development and not yet stable, but the examples here should give you an idea of the direction that the language is headed. You can also check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jammmo/serene).

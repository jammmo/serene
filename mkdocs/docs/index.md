# Introduction

Serene is a minimalist readable systems programming language designed by Jamie Moschella (`@jammmo`). This site will walk you through the basic design of the language as well as several code examples. Serene is in the very early design stages right now, so there is no working compiler or full documentation yet, but the examples here should give you an idea of the direction that the language is headed. You can also check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jammmo/serene-ideas).
